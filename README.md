# A.I. Drone M1.0

## Summary
- This project will use the mechanical frame of a retail drone. 
  - Make: DJI
  - Model: Maxis Mini I 
- **I will design my own PCBs** and exchange them for the boards provided with the product. 
  - PCBs will be designed to fit the dimensions, I/O, and performance needs of the Maxis Mini I. 
- **I will create my own firmware.** The firmware will be created such that the drone can run programs in python. 
  - I will not be creating my own compiler. 
  - The open source compiler can be found here: 
    - *Insert Link*
- **I will design a neural network(s)** to provide application for the drone. 
  - M1.0 will utilize an object recognition software. 
  - Intended to be a relativly basic deep learning network that can be scaled to fit the applications of MarkN(s) to come.
